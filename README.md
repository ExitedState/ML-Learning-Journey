# My Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository documents my self-taught journey to learn Machine Learning from scratch. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of machine learning, starting from the basic mathematical, data-structure and algorithm.

## Overview

- **Day1 (1 June 2023)** Review my Linear Algebra, Calculus, Prob/Stat, Python and overview concept of ML
- **Day2** Concept Learning : Find-S, List-Then-Eliminate (clustering)
- **Day3** Candidate Elimination
- **Day4-6** Focused on understanding and implementing the k-NN
- **Day7** learn more numpy useful functions and methods
 
_END OF WEEK 1_

_WEEK 2_
- **Day8++**  I'm progressing through the 'Introduction to Machine Learning' course on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction). Below, I've shared what I've learned so far.
- Linear regression with one variable
  - Cost function
  - Gradient Descent
- Multiple linear regression
  - Vectorization
